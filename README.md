* This code makes use of various significant modules and libraries such as React, chart.js, react-chartjs-2, and papaparse to accomplish its objective. Essentially this code plots a Graph representing word frequency by processing data obtained from an online text file through papaparse and generating CSV formatted information thereby enabling construction of an informative histogram.

* To begin, we utilize the useState function to specify the primary state of both chartData and csvs. Next, a constant option is established to determine the visual attributes and design of the chart. Additionally, we generate a function called fetchdata that retrieves data from an online resource and sifts it for solely unique words.

* Firstly, the code establishes a collection of topdata with the assistance of a for loop and filters out redundant words in an array. Thereafter, the finaldata identifies the most common 20 words by sorting topdata in descending order based on frequency and subsequent slicing to retrieve the first 20 terms. Subsequently, chartData is generated by defining labels and data arrays to facilitate chart plotting while a CSV file is produced using PapaParse.


* A button enabling users to fetch data and plot histograms is at their disposal. When chartData has useful information, users can view a chart and download it via another button. Components outside of this scope can also benefit from using the exported Comps function.
